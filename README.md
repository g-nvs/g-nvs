I am an IT professionnal with a deep interest in technology, cybersecurity and a dedication to investigate and solve complex problems. <br>
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity over the years. <br>
This is just a collection of projects and tools I made to try new technologies, for learning purposes, curiosity and new skills! A curiosity cabinet, we could say.
